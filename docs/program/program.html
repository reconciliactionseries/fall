<li><p><em>Lara’s grandmother was one of the more than 150,000 Indigenous children that were taken away from their homes and families to a residential school. Now we are in a place of reconciliation through healing and hope. Hope for the future. Hope for things to get better. For the past nearly 10 years, Lara has been working on reclaiming her identity and embracing her culture. Reclamation through reading, asking questions, attending events in the Indigenous communities close to Fraser Lake, British Columbia and listening to the voices of Indigenous peoples around her who she can learn from.</em></p></li>
<li><p>5 p.m.: Words of appreciation followed by a <strong>Closing Ceremony</strong> by Elder Dr.&nbsp;Joe Michael.</p></li>

<li><p>Focus: As Honourable Justice Murray Sinclair, Chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission said in 2016, “Education got us into this mess and education will get us out of it”. Despite education institutions efforts through things like land acknowledgements and events, there is still much more to accomplish for the educational systems in Canada to truly be decolonized. Lara has worked with a BC School District and the Maple League of Universities on this idea of decolonizing education and Indigenizing what is on the curriculum or in the syllabi.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Description:</strong> Acadia University students delve into their thoughts and feelings about climate change and their own identity in connection to nature. This includes an exploration of childhood to the present memories and experiences. It is done by choosing a tree they feel most connected to and writing a two-page poem about their tree and weaving it altogether. The poems will be temporarily attached to trees. This event is an interactive installation and includes poetry reading, embracing of personal trees and those of others. This is a powerful symbolic gesture of acceptance of differences and love of self, others and the very trees that nurture us.</p></li>

</ul>
<p>Growing up, Lara heard stories about the tragedy and was always told not to hitch-hike and to be careful along the highway. As a child, she understood but did not comprehend as much as she does now. Although Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls are an ongoing tragedy across Canada from coast to coast to coast, but Lara will be talking about BC, specifically the Highway of Tears. The Highway of Tears is another name for a stretch of Highway 16 in North-Central British Columbia. This part of the highway runs from Prince George to Prince Rupert, covering 724 kilometres. In order to come to a place where Indigenous women and girls are safe and do not need to live in fear, we must look to the structures that are responsible for allowing these atrocities to happen. We need to acknowledge that it is structural and come to terms with an answer. I do have hope, though, because without hope, what do we really have?</p>

<p><u><strong>Rosemary Cooper, Executive Director of Pauktuutit, the National Inuit Women’s Advocacy Organization.</strong></u></p>
<p><em>Since joining Pauktuutit in 2016, Rosemary has built a legacy of providing inspiring leadership to Pauktuutit’s policy, programs, and communications teams to achieve progress on the Board’s resolutions and priorities. As well, she has deep experience advocating for the interests of Inuit women and girls to officials in federal government departments and agencies. Rosemary also has a strong track record of working collaboratively with Inuit partners in Inuit Nunangat, in urban centres and at the national level. Rosemary led Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami’s work with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. She also represented Pauktuutit from the inception of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) through to the release of the final report, with 46 Inuit-specific Calls for Justice. Rosemary is now Pauktuutit’s representative on the Core Working Group for the co-development of the MMIWG National Action Plan, with the Government of Canada. Prior to joining Pauktuutit, Rosemary held senior portfolios in the Government of Nunavut, including Director of Social Programs at the Office of the Interim Commissioner; Assistant Deputy Minister, Department of Health and Social Services; and Assistant Deputy Minister, Executive and Intergovernmental Affairs. She has also served as a Political Advisor at Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK). Born and raised in Iqaluit, Nunavut, Rosemary is Inuk and fluent in Inuktut and English. Her progressive career achievements have contributed to her profile as an expert in Inuit affairs. This experience includes advocacy and leadership for the development of policy, legislation, and programs to strengthen violence prevention, community policing, investments in social services and health care and the promotion of Inuit arts and culture. Over the past 30 years, Rosemary’s work with international, national, territorial, and regional organizations and bodies has included: The United Nations Commission on Status of &nbsp;Women, The United Nations Secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, The Federation of Councils, the Office of the Governor General of Canada, the Inuit Crown Partnership Committee, the National Inuit Housing Working Group and the Canadian Millennium Scholarship Foundation. Championing the human rights of Inuit women and girls, including the protection and support of women and children fleeing violence, are passions central to Rosemary’s work.</em></p>

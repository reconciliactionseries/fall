These reports highlight the importance of early education for Indigenous children. Although our focus is on issues faced by Indigenous communities, we want to emphasize that, as non-Indigenous researchers, it would be unethical for us to make policy recommendations because we cannot fully understand the needs and experiences of Indigenous peoples. We present this report simply as a summary of our research in an introductory public policy course. In our research, we have prioritized listening to and learning from Indigenous voices. We have mainly used Indigenous sources, including the Assembly of First Nations, the Center for Indigenous Education, the First Nations Education Steering Committee, the Truth and Reconciliation Final Report, the Native Women’s Association of Canada, Dr. Piita Irniq, Brooke Paul, and Lara Hartman. Our team focused on gathering information from Indigenous news outlets, including The Turtle Island News, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, and APTN. Drafting this report has taught us the importance of exploring Indigenous policy ideas and perspectives. This class has shown us the importance of learning from Indigenous experts, and we are honoured to have had the chance to do so through conversations with Indigenous policy experts, elders, and community members. We have engaged through Fall 2024 Kesalul! ReconciliACTION Series. We sincerely thank the Indigenous policy experts who shared their knowledge and expertise with us, including Lara Hartman, Brooke Paul, Dr. Piita Irniq, and Cole Kippenhuck. We also thank CEWIL Canada for their generous grant to our class. Our gratitude extends to Dr. Cynthia Alexander and our class partner, Darlene Peters Copeland, for their valuable feedback, knowledge, and support. This course has enabled us to delve deeper and move beyond our usual sources. Throughout this report, we have strived to further our decolonization journey and to better understand the sources and their validity.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

This opportunity offered students, the campus, and the local community a unique opportunity to listen, learn, and engage with Indigenous experts from across Canada through a series of public events in the Fall 2024 academic semester at Acadia University. Students also had the opportunity to engage with Indigenous experts during classtime. The project was established by a relationship with the Mi’kmaq partner and with Indigenous community experts from across Canada who engaged in policy dialogues, in-person or virtually, addressing a range of issues and opportunities related to Canada’s commitment to acting upon the 94 Calls to Action of the National Truth and Reconciliation of Canada’s Final Report (2015) The public events brought together together Indigenous Elders, knowledge holders, artists, policy leaders, and students for a unique experiential learning journey.\nThe ReconciliACTION Series is a celebration of Indigenous knowledge and critical hope, contributes to ongoing efforts toward truth and reconciliation, and honours the spirit of “Kesalul!”, which means “I love you”, through ReconciliACTION.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "In POLS 1303: Introduction to Public Policy at Acadia University, students researched the social determinants of health in Indigenous communities, with a particular focus on the importance of early education. As non-Indigenous researchers, we recognize that it would be inappropriate to make policy recommendations, since we cannot fully represent Indigenous needs and experiences. These reports are therefore presented as a summary of our learning in the course. Our research prioritized Indigenous perspectives, drawing on sources such as the Assembly of First Nations, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Final Report, the Native Women’s Association of Canada, Indigenous scholars, and Indigenous media outlets like APTN News and The Turtle Island News. This process taught us the value of grounding public policy discussions in Indigenous voices and knowledge. We are grateful for the opportunity to learn from Indigenous policy experts, Elders, and community members through initiatives in Fall 2024 Kesalul! ReconciliACTION Series. Their guidance deepened our understanding of reconciliation and the ongoing impact of colonial policies. This project has enabled us to take further steps in our own decolonization journey while critically reflecting on the sources we use and the perspectives they represent.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

We aim to share our knowledge and elevate Inuit voices on critical issues, such as housing, education, food insecurity, and cultural preservation, and advocate for meaningful changes that foster resilience and well-being. Our policy briefs highlight key issues Inuit communities face and offer actionable insights for positive change. We hope to engage others in recognizing these challenges and to inspire support for justice, reconciliation, and the strengthening of Inuit communities’ resilience.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

ReconciliACTION Quilt\n9:45 a.m.: Opening Prayer and Words of Welcome\n10 – 11 a.m.: The Highway of Tears: North Central BC and Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, Indigenous Expert Keynote with Lara Hartman.\n\nGrowing up, Lara heard stories about the tragedy and was always told not to hitch-hike and to be careful along the highway. As a child, she understood but did not comprehend as much as she does now. Although Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls are an ongoing tragedy across Canada from coast to coast to coast, but Lara will be talking about BC, specifically the Highway of Tears. The Highway of Tears is another name for a stretch of Highway 16 in North-Central British Columbia. This part of the highway runs from Prince George to Prince Rupert, covering 724 kilometres. In order to come to a place where Indigenous women and girls are safe and do not need to live in fear, we must look to the structures that are responsible for allowing these atrocities to happen. We need to acknowledge that it is structural and come to terms with an answer. I do have hope, though, because without hope, what do we really have?\n\n11 – 12 noon: Flash Circle – Show up to the Acadia U Quad wearing something red\n12:30 – 2 p.m.: Reflections from Elder Dr. Joe Michael, Elder Dr. Lorraine Peters-Whitman, Elder Ella Paul, Elder Dr. Piita Irniq, Ann Sylliboy, Brooke Paul, Holly Meuse, Kayla Mansfield-Brown, Lara Hartman, Debbie Toney, Mary Nicholas, Poppy Conley\n2 – 2:30 p.m.: Unveiling the Inuksuk created by Dr. Piita Irniq for Acadia University.\n2:30 pm: Closing Ceremony."
